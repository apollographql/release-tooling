_This repository contains release tooling for Apollo GraphQL software which are required by some of our public repos,
while you are free to take these workflows as examples, directly executing them will not work as they require 
credentials and access that can only be obtained within Apollo GraphQL._

# Apollo Release Tooling

In the longer term documentation will move to this repository. However, for now the documentation exists as a series of 
Runbooks that can be found [here](https://apollographql.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RUNTIMEREADINESS/folder/2139193384?atlOrigin=eyJpIjoiNmJkOGE4ZGJiYzZkNGQwN2FiZjY4NWJmODQ0ZDlkYTkiLCJwIjoiYyJ9)
